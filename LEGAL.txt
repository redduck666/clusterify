 THIRD PARTY CLAIMS 
=========================================

(See CPAL Section 3.4(a)):

A LICENSE (or similarly named) file has been added to subdirectories of code
modules used in the project and distributed with it. Please refer to those
files for license information concerning each of those modules.

In the "registration" subdirectory, heavy additions were made to the
original django-registration module, but are isolated at ends of certain files.
Those ends are clearly indicated with a different license block prepended
to the sections which are concerned.
